# Heart-Disease-Prediction
It is a prediction system that predicts Heart Disease of a person by analysing various characterstics of a person.
Such restecg, cp, thalach etc.
I have tried various machine learning algorithms to check which of them shows the highest accuracy score 
And by experimenting these algorithms it was concluded that when we use random forest classifier, it showed the highest accuracy score of 84% which is comparively way higher than other algorithms.
